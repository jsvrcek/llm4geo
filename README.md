### Getting Started

Install the dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment.)
Copy the qllm4geo folder into your QGIS plugin directory. 
For example on windows C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins..
the result should have a qllm4geo folder in the plugins directory.

When you start QGIS you should see qllm4geo in your plugins (you may need to enable it).
